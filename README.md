# Juice Shop 

This is the Frontend version of the Juice Shop webapp, built with ReactJs

## Features 

### React - Redux

This webapp uses the react-redux library to store/ update an individual product, all available products, and the current products within the cart. 

### Mobile Friendly

This app adjusts to different browser sizes using css styling. 


## Still in Progress

### Static Juice Shop Data

The current data being displayed is of convenience and does not reflect the juiceshop. The static data is still being developed. 

### Payment Processing 

Currently, items can be added to cart, but no checkout page has been created, nor can payments be processed. Exploring the Stripe technology for payment processing.
